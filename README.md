# talent_vs_luck
A Monte Carlo and agent based exploration into how much luck plays a role in success

## About this project
Some time ago I came across [Is Success Luck or Hard Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I) video by `Veritasium`.

It puts forward and interesting question, namely, how influential is luck in success?

In this project I employ `OOP`, `Monte Carlo` and `Agentic` simulation methodology to see how much luck plays a role in success.

The crux of this project comes down to every person as a luck score and a talent score. I will pick these scores from a `uniform` or `normal` distribution and see how much any changes in luck will influence success.
